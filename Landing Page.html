            <h3> A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h3>
            <p>
                The combined experience I have workig at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that
                helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
                <br>
                <br>   I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how
                to <i>sell</i> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br>
                As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.
                <br>
                <br>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean
                <br>
                <br> "How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you wouldn't fail?"
                You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something
                you're <i>passionate</i> about.
                <br>
                <br> I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
